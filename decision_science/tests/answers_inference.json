    "MEDIAN_AGE": "\nFollowing the parameters of the regression model, the median age is associated with a positive effect.\nAn increase of 1 of in median age would increase the number of incident by 2 253.\nBUT, when looking at p-values (at 0.12) we can say that this result is NOT statistically significant\n",
    "T_STAT": "\nGiven that the size of the sample is relatively small here, \nwe will use a Student test to reject the hypothesis :\n'the number of incidents is not linearly correlated to median age everything else being equal OR simply said coeff should be 0'\n\nThe student statistic is compute as the ratio of :\nnumerator = the coefficient computed on the sample - the mean under the hypothesis (so 0)\ndenominator = the standard deviation of this coefficient on the sample\n",
    "P_VALUE": "\nthe p-value is telling us that this is not statistically significant at the 95% or 90% confidence interval.\nIt would be at 87%\n",
    "INCREASE": "\neverything else being constant,\nif the share of families with a married couple increases by 1 percentage point in the district,\nthen the number of incidents is estimated to decrease by 2 115 with a 95% confidence interval being 3165 to 1065.\n",
    "LIMITATIONS": "\nWhen analysing the results of a linear regression, the statistical significance of the parameters needs to be looked at with p-values.\nThe p-values themselves should be trusted only if the residuals are actually with zero mean and constant variance.\n\nBUT here we have an additional highlight with high standard deviation of coefficient. This is a symptom of multicolinearity.\nMost probably the explanatory variables are too correlated .\n"
